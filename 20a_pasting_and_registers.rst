============================================

Documentation::

    ["x]p

    Put the text [from register x] after the cursor
    [count] times.

``:help p``

::

    You can repeat the put commands with "."
    (except for :put) and undo them.

``:help linewise-register``

**But** in visual mode::

    The previously selected text is put in the unnamed register.

``:help v_p``
