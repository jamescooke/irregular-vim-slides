Incrementing number after cursor is predictable
===============================================

But make sure you're configured first!
--------------------------------------

This "feature" is documented::

    When 'nrformats' includes "octal", Vim considers numbers
    starting with a '0' to be octal, unless the number
    includes a '8' or '9'.

``:help nrformats``
``:set nrformats``
