A talk at Vim London
--------------------

These are my slides from my `Irregular Vim talk
<http://jamescooke.info/irregular-vim.html>`_ at Vim London.

How to?
-------

Clone this repository as usual, then open all slides with no ``.vimrc`` file
active::

    vim slides/* -u NONE

Go from one slide to the next with ``:n``.
