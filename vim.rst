# Irregular stuff in vim

## Word cutting

``cw`` vs ``ce`` (from drew)

## Paste in visual

When pasting in visual, then the pasted over text goes into the register. So multiple pasting is not possible.

## Actions (needs research)

``.`` actions versus ``@`` actions versus ``^o`` (magic bullet) actions.

## Delete verb and movement

Comparing:

* ``dj`` / ``d2j``
* ``d2h``
* ``d2gj``

## Visual mode stacking

## Magic bullet and undo

## Configuration

### increment and decrement and octal


* Create a double spaced word e.g. ``hello  there``.
* Set the cursor before 't'.
* Press 'a', press backspace, both whitespaces disappear.
